# Google Cardboard + Three.js + D3 Basic Example

Created from a [tutorial I found on Storybench](http://www.storybench.org/how-to-make-a-simple-virtual-reality-data-visualization/). [Source code here](https://github.com/rogerkenny/3D-chart-tutorial). 

I adapted the tutorial to use the [webvr-boilerplate](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate).  

I also added a [Chrome experiments style reticule](https://vr.chromeexperiments.com/), adapted from a [small reticle THREE.js library](https://github.com/GQPBJ/Reticulum) I found on github.
